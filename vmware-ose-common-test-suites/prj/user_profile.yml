# Two vCD organizations are needed for acl related testing.
# With OSE solution, the vCD organization is mapping to a group in vendor. So additional users are needed for
# ACL testing.
#
# vCD organization1 (Group1) is the main test group, user1 and user2 are created in vCD in this organization.
# The user's role is "Tenant User".
# Use "username@tenantname" format as input, like user1@org1 and user2@org1.
#
# vCD organization2 (Group2) is the validation group, one user user1@org2 is created.
#
# user1@org1 is the test user, user2@org1 is to validate the access ability of different user in same group, and
# user1@org2 is to validate the access ability of user in different groups.
